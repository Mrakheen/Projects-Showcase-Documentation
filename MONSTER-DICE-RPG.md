## ABOUT THE GAME:
### >> The Game consists of a 6 by 5 Grid where 2 Monsters and a Player are spawned. 
### >> The Player can Attack or Disarm both the Monsters (if both in range) or one of the Monsters (if one of them in range).
### >> To be in range the Monster(s) must be in adjacent grid block to the Player grid block.
### >> The Player's Attack can be a hit or a miss depending on the number generated using the input of d20 in rolldice function in GameUtility.
### >> The Player's Attack damage depends on the value of its dice of its choosen weapon (example 1d18). 
### >> A Monster will attempt to Attack the Player everytime the Player Attacks a Monster (doesn't matter if the Player hit or misses) or everytime a Player Disarms the Monster.
### >> The Monster can also hit or miss its Attack depending on the number generated using the input of d20 in rolldice function in GameUtility.
### >> Everytime the Player Moves, Attacks, or Disarms a Monster or Monsters, both the Monsters moves by 1 grid block in a random direction (Up, Down, Left, or Right). 
### >> If the Monster gets Disarmed it will miss all its Attacks within a 5 second timer.
### >> If the player is able to defeat both of the Monsters i.e. get both of the Monsters' HP to 0, the Player wins.
